This will be a website that will talk about me and my path through coding. I was being a dummy and deleted everything I had up to this point, repositories, local files, etc... I have been coding with TheOdinProject since Jan 28, 2021. Today I was overthinking the rock, paper, scissors assignment and got really frustrated. I am now rebuilding everything. 
Things I want this site to cover:  
    About me Section
    Links to my github
    Different skills I have learned
